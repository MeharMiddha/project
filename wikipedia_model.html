    <h2><textarea name="intoduction" id="introduction" cols="200" rows="5"> Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS (/ˈrɑːmən/;[1] 7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering.[2] Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.[3]</textarea></h2>

        <li>In 1924, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society early in his career and was knighted in 1929.</li>
        <li>He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930.</li>
        <li>He was awarded the Franklin Medal in 1941.</li>
        <li>He was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1954, the highest civilian award in India.</li>
        <li>In 1957, he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize.</li>
        <li>The American Chemical Society and the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in 1998 recognized Raman’s discovery as an International Historic Chemical Landmark</li>
        <li>On 28 February every year, India celebrates National Science Day to commemorate the discovery of the Raman Effect in 1928 in his honor.</li>
        <li>In 1970, he received a major heart attack while working in the laboratory. He took his last breath in the Raman Research Institute on 21st November 1970.</li>
        <li>Raman was appointed director of the newly established Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore in 1933.</li>
        <li>The IISc was established in 1909 with the aim of conducting original research and providing science and engineering education.</li>
        <li>The new government of Independent India named him the country's first National Professor in 1947.</li>
        <li>In 1948, he retired from the Indian Institute of Science and a year later founded the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, Karnataka, where he served as director until he died in 1970.</li>
        <li>Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 for his research on light scattering and the discovery of the Raman effect. The inelastic scattering of a photon is known as "Raman scattering" or "Raman effect." This phenomenon is the basis for Raman spectroscopy</li>
        <li>Between 1916 and 1921, he researched and published a lot of his observations. Based on the superposition of velocities, he developed the principle of transverse vibration of bowed string instruments. The wolf tone in violins and cellos was one of his earliest experiments. He investigated the acoustics of various violins and related instruments, as well as water splashes and Indian stringed instruments. "Experiments with mechanically-played violins" was one of his works.</li>
        <li>C V Raman Discovery behind the Blue colour of the sea- In 1919, Raman began investigating light scattering as part of his broadening foray into optics. His first amazing discovery was the mechanics of seawater's blue colour. In September 1921, he reflected on the Mediterranean Sea's blue colour while sailing home from England on the S.S. Narkunda.</li>
        <li>He tested the seawater with basic optical instruments, including a pocket-sized spectroscope and a Nicol prism. No.56 Lord Rayleigh's explanation in 1910, </li>
        <li>Raman's discovery was hailed by physicists as evidence of quantum theory. The vibrational Raman effect is of primary interest to chemists. The Raman Effect was named a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in 1998, in recognition of its importance as a method for studying the structure of liquids, gases, and solids.</li>
